CS 97 L2 

Three topics: 

* Emacs intro - text editor + development enviroment 	) MIT thing 1980's
* Unix/Linux/POSIX file system organization 			) Bell labs thing 1960
* Command-line basics and the Unix/Linux/POSIX shell 	)

We are developing apps, we want them to: 
- survive power outages 
	(persistence) (persisant data)
	note: peristent means that smt will stay even if the file crashes
- be fast ie. we type something we want it to show on the screen fast
	* so we cannot make everything persistent because secondary storage is too slow
	* aside: hard disks are pretty slow
			 flash drives are still pretty slow too for interactive
			 newer devices may be better
- be understandable 
	1) easy to read 
	2) easy to maintain 
	3) easy to write 

Emacs provides a view into this situtation 
- a bit tricky because Emacs itself is an app 
Which means you can use Emacs to view itself 
- It's "reflective", it can look at itself like a "mirror"

How can you enter Emacs to edit a file? 
- Log into SEASnet
- shell command: 'emacs filename'
- usually just type plain 'emacs' 
- C-x C-f filename RET 

Note: 
C = control  (C-x means hold down the ctrl key and type x)
RET = return / enter
SPC = space 
MISSING STUFF :(



control h k Enter 

hold down control key
type h 
type k 
type Enter

Emacs then pops up a *Help* buffer that explains what that key will do 

What does C-x C-f do?
- Type "C-h k C-x C-f " to see what it does 
- it creates a new buffer holding the contents of the named file and switches to that buffer 

TERMINOLOGY 
File - persistent sequence of bytes stored in a filesystem 
Filesystem - persistent data structure representing a set of files 
Buffer - non persistent sequence of bytes in particular Emacs session 
Window - (Emacs) view of a buffer
	ie. two windows  1) notes.txt file  2) looks at *help* buffer 
	Windows have a (typically) view of the buffer contents 
frame - (Emacs) what everyone else calls a window 
	Zoom clals frames a "windows" 

Where is the buffer stored? 
- it is only in RAM.

What is SSH 
- Secure Shell (aside: this is just a marketing term)
- establishes an encrypted connection (relatively secure) connection between your computer and (for example) SEASnet

Will the meta key be ESC if we're using emacs while using ssh?
- yes and no. ALT key should work just like locally but if not you can also type "ESC x" instead of "M-x"

What does x forwarding mean? 
- see demo

What is the difference between linux posix and the third one? 
Unix - orignal system designed at BEll labs 
	   * derived from multics
	   * has a lot of variants
POSIX - standardized verision (common subset)
GNU/Linux - most popular variant 
	("linux" is hte name of the kernel)

What is a locale?
- a locale is a language+country enviroment 
- part of the process of *localization*
Internatiolization: the process of makin gyour program localizable 
- Emacs is partly internationalized, uses locales, can handle a lot of languages but is partly english only 

C-x 0
C-x 1
C-x 2
C-x 3 // create a new window side by sisde
C-x 5

C-h k K // find out what key K does
C-h b 	// key bindings
C-h m 	// current mode: Emacs is a *modeful* editior, it has states that 
			governs how it intreprets your commands
			C-j in this window can mean one thing (insert a new line)
			C-j in another window can mean smt else ie. *scratch* buffer

C-h t // tutorial
C-h i // info 

C-x b NAME // switch to the buffer NAME, use TAB to autocomplete 

C-x C-b // list all your buffers 
C-x C-f FILENAME // vist FILENAME
C-x C-s // save your current buffer : necessary to make it persist 
C-x d DIRNAME RET // visit a directory (default is current directory)
	you are in dired mode, editing that directory

File and file systems 
	Files are byte sequences 
	 ls lists the files in the current directory 
	 	ls -l : list details 
	 	ls -a : list all files, even "hidden" ones 
	 				(start with ".")
	 So there are at least two kinds of files 
	 Directories are files that contain lists of file name components and what they mean
