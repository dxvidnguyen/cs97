1) Find the mergepoint M at 7dd52bfd8e503316b4aa9c5767850d3985626b26 (2020-10-17) and the commit C at c00606171f88be0df2c19346fa53f401ea71c71f (2020-10-10) and describe the relationship between C and M, by drawing a graph containing all paths from C to M. Your diagram need not list every commit in all the paths, but you should label and list every commit with more than one parent, or with more than one child. For example, your graph should have a node labeled C and M because C has multiple childen and M has multiple parents, and the graphâ€™s legend should say that C is c00606171f88be0df2c19346fa53f401ea71c71f and that M is 7dd52bfd8e503316b4aa9c5767850d3985626b26.

Note: I will personally be describing everything as levels similar to how generations work because that is what this reminds me of and it is sort of a family tree. 

So we start with commit M and are on level 0
Commit M: 7dd52bfd8e503316b4aa9c5767850d3985626b26 

Now we are on level 1 
Commit M has two parents (commits P1 and P2) 
Commit P1: ffd201c47e8e32b10961d5679f48860fba411fde
Commit P2: 18c0e20bea07cf4591b45800205cf25a927045f6

Now we are on level 2 
Commit P2 has one parent (commit P3) 
Commit P3: 47b8a1c7672608f220c3e0d7f6cedc63e6f63386

Commit P1 has two parents (commits P3 and P4) 
note: one of P1's parents is the same as P2's only parent (P3)
 
 Note: we only have P3 and P4 on level two

Now we are on level 3 
Commit P3 has only one parent 
Commit: 65078e0a760950783e56f6765465a59bd642e8e4

Commit P4 has two parents 
Commit: 65078e0a760950783e56f6765465a59bd642e8e4
Commit P5: 2f45054208ccc3fbd53b7f4d6bbaba92afa075c1 

Note: will not give P<num> names to commits that do not lead to commit C
Note: now that we know that commit P3 will not lead to commit C
	--> we will no longer follow commit P3 down 

Now we are on level 4
Commit P5 has 2 parents
Commit P6: f539ee9042f6eb30eecf928effab715396144744
Commit: e569efb15f3a642376c5d45afb449a302d99da47

Note: since only P6 will lead to commit C we will only follow P6 and 
ignore the other parent of P5(the other parent will have parents but because
It does not lead to commit C we do not need it) 

Now we are on level 5
Commit P6 has one parent which is commit C!
Commit C: c00606171f88be0df2c19346fa53f401ea71c71f





2) Clone the GNU Emacs git repository yourself from Savannah, and briefly describe the differences between your repository and the one in ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs. (Hint: look at the output of git branch.)
