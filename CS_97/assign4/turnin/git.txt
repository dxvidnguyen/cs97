3) And now for a more open-ended search. The Git 2.30.1 Release Notes (2021-02-08) say "Newline characters in the host and path part of git:// URL are now forbidden." Which code change or changes actually made this happen, and who authored the change? Do not worry about subsequent administrative changes such as merge commits; look for the original changes that actually fixed the problem in question. Give the SHA1 commit IDs for the relevant changes, and explain how you discovered them, all in a text file git.txt. Also generate patch files for the relevant changes, in git format-patch format.

to make a clone directory
git clone https://github.com/git/git.git

git log -S <text> 

first i go into the clone directory

use git log -S "Newline characters in the host and path part of git:// URL are now forbidden"
- didnt work

now trying
git log -S "Newline characters in the host and path"

scroll down to see 
The previous commit taught the clone/fetch client side to reject a
    git:// URL with a newline in it. Let's also catch these when fscking a
    .gitmodules file, which will give an earlier warning.

 need to go to previous commit 
 commit a02ea577174ab8ed18f847cf1693f213e0b9c473

 we see:
 if (strchr(target_host, '\n') || strchr(path, '\n'))
+               die(_("newline is forbidden in git:// hosts and repo paths"));
 
        /*
- code that fixes the issue

Need to make  patch
git format-patch -1 <commitID> 
git format-patch -1 a02ea577174ab8ed18f847cf1693f213e0b9c473

we get this file 
0001-git_connect_git-forbid-newlines-in-host-and-path.patch

use command 
git add 0001-git_connect_git-forbid-newlines-in-host-and-path.patch

and now the file has been added
