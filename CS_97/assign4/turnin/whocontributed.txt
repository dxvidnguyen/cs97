 # United States
 
+# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1995-12-19):
+# A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
+# Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
+# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
+# Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it.
+# It is the source for the US and Puerto Rico entries below.

if we go into the northamerica file we see that eggert wrote 

Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
# Those Hoosiers!  Such a flighty and changeable people!
# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.

This is a quote and it does give creidt to Shanks
