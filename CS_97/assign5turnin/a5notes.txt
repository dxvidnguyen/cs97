Notes for Assignment 5:

First we need to make tests to make sure the file works
- need to edit in the makefile
Need to go into makefile
- make a check target (needs randall and tester script)
- use check target to run testerscript.sh
- testerscript will have a code to test to see if randall works
Need to make testerScript.sh
- one time : check if it outputs the correct amount of characters
- need to give it excecute permissions  (use chmod +x testerscript.sh)
Using the testerScript:
- can just run it with ./testerScript
- run with makefile by using make check (bc it uses the check target)

Now we need to make all the files to split up the randall code:
- make files and headers with touch
touch options.c options.h output.c output.h
touch rand64-hw.c rand64-hw.h rand64-sw.c rand64-sw.h
- in general to add a header to a c file
  #include "<headerName>.h"
Header files (.h) are designed to provide the information that will be needed in multiple files. Thing\
s like class declarations, function prototypes, and enumerations typically go in header files. In a wo\
rd, "definitions"

In order to take from the randall.c file
C-spc set mark
C-w   kill (similar to cut)
C-y   yank (similar to paste)

Note: Remove static from everywhere
- need to do this  because static restricts the usage of a function to a specific file. Which is good if you want to protect that function or be able to re-use that name in other locations. 

Options
- in the main function has the part that loooks
Output 
- write bytes function
- do while loop that prints by calling writebytes 
- do not add do while loop just use write bytes
rand64-hw
- above the main function
rand64-sw
- above the main function
